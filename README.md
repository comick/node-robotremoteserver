# robotremote

![Node Robot Remote Server CI](https://github.com/comick/node-robotremoteserver/workflows/Node%20Robot%20Remote%20Server%20CI/badge.svg)

  A node.js module providing the [robot framework](http://www.robotframework.org) remote library interface.
  Also provide convenient remote library interface client.

## Installation

Install [robot framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst) first. Then:

    $ npm install robotremote

## Example

Just little example with main features. Test folder contains better extensive examples for more features.

examplelibrary.js:

```js
'use strict';

var readdir = require('promise').denodeify(require('fs').readdir),
    robot = require('../lib/robotremote'),
    assert = require('assert');

var lib = module.exports;

/**
 * Example of asynchronous keyword.
 *
 * You can implement asynchronous keywords just returning an A+ promise.
 * Promise can be resolved or rejected with respectively:
 *
 * - arbitrary return value, or
 * - an instance of `Error` if the keyword failed
 *
 * Just count items in given directory.
 *
 * @param path directory path to count item in.
 */
 lib.countItemsInDirectory = function (path) {
    return readdir(path).then(function (files) {
        return files.length;
    });
};
// The doc attribute is used for inspection on the command line of client and doc generation.
// It's optional and defaults to empty string when missing.
lib.countItemsInDirectory.doc = 'Returns the number of items in the directory specified by `path`.';

/**
 * Example synchronous keyword.
 *
 * Any keyword which does not return an A+ promise is considered sync.
 * The following are considered successes:
 *
 * - the keyword returns `undefined` (that is doesn't return any value)
 * - the keyword return any other value
 *
 * While any thrown `Error` instance will lead the keyword failure.
 *
 * Each keyword also have the output writer, which enables logging at various levels.
 * Here warn level is showed as an example.
 * All robot levels are supported including messages with timestamp through timestamp`Level` function.
 * See http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#logging-information
 *
 * @param str1
 * @param str2
 */
lib.stringsShouldBeEqual = function (str1, str2) {
    this.output.warn('Comparing \'%s\' to \'%s\'', str1, str2);
    assert.equal(str1, str2, 'Given strings are not equal');
};


// Run this keyword library if the library itself is called explicitly.
if (!module.parent) {
    var server = new robot.Server([lib], { host: 'localhost', port: 8270 });
}
```

remote_tests.robot:

```
*** Settings ***
Library    Remote    http://localhost:${PORT}

*** Variables ***
${HOST}    localhost
${PORT}    8270

*** Test Cases ***

Count Items in Directory
    ${items1} =    Count Items In Directory    ${CURDIR}
    ${items2} =    Count Items In Directory    ${TEMPDIR}
    Log    ${items1} items in '${CURDIR}' and ${items2} items in '${TEMPDIR}'

Failing Example
    Strings Should Be Equal    Hello    Hello
    Strings Should Be Equal    not      equal
```

Run the remote server:

    $ node example/examplelibrary.js

Then launch tests:

    $ pybot example/remote_tests.robot

## Using botclient.js:

The botclient.js command line utility can be useful to test keywords of any compliant running robot remote server.

An example session with the example keywords library follows:

```js
$ node ./bin/botclient.js localhost 8270
Connected to remote server at "localhost:8270"
Available keywords: stopRemoteServer, countItemsInDirectory, stringsShouldBeEqual
localhost:8270> keywords.countItemsInDirectory
{ [Function]
  args: [ 'path' ],
  docs: 'Returns the number of items in the directory specified by `path`.' }
localhost:8270> keywords.stringsShouldBeEqual
{ [Function]
  args: [ 'str1', 'str2' ],
  docs: '' }
localhost:8270> keywords.stringsShouldBeEqual('ciao', 'ciao').done(console.log)
undefined
localhost:8270> { output: '*WARN* Comparing \'ciao\' to \'ciao\'\n',
  status: 'PASS',
  return: '' }
```

Keywords are available in context in the keywords dictionary. When called they return an A+ promise.
